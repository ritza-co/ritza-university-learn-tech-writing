# Learn to Write as a Coder or Learn to Code as a Writer

This is course with two tracks.

* [Coding for Writers](./coding-for-writers.md) if you now how to write and want to learn how to code
* [Writing for Coders](./writing-for-coders.md) if you know how to code and want to learn how to write.

The tracks are run in parallel and share weekly meetings. You will get guidance from our team, and you will also assist people in the other track who are learning what you already have expertise in.
