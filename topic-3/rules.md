# Ritza's rules for writing

The rules that are guaranteed to make you a better writer. These rules are not for breaking.

## Rule #1

**Write every day.**

## Rule #2

**Read.**

## Rule #3

**Know your audience.**

We'll examine this rule in more detail in Week 3 of the course, but in short, "knowing your audience" means thinking about your writing in terms of how and why the reader will read it. As Larry McEnerney says in the video "The Craft of Writing Effectively", the value of writing "lies in readers."

Practically, knowing your audience reflects in these aspects of your writing:
* Your tone.
* The words you choose to use.
* The level of complexity of the piece.
* How you structure the information.

Until we address this aspect of writing more closely, begin practising writing with your reader in mind. Start with today's writing assignment. Think about:
* What does your reader know, what don't they know?
* What do you need to tell them first?
* Can you make the "why" of your instructions clear, as well as the "how"?

The challenge of this skill is in finding how to be clear and detailed enough in your writing without patronising your reader.

For this assignment and all your writing from now on, imagine your reader as someone with infinite intelligence, but limited knowledge.
