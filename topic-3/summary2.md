# Chapter 2: Simplicity

Simplicity, William Zinsser tells us in Chapter 2, makes your writing easier to understand.

Eliminate clutter. Remove:
* Unnecessary words
* Circular constructions (this applies to overall structure as well as sentence structure)
* Pompous frills
* Meaningless jargon

“But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.”

Aim for strong sentences:
* Take out any words that serve no function.
* Prefer short words over long words.
* Check that adverbs are strictly necessary: does the verb already do all the work?
* Passive voice can be clumsy and misleading.

“Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can’t exist without the other. It’s impossible for a muddy thinker to write good English. He may get away with it for a paragraph or two, but soon the reader will be lost, and there’s no sin so grave, for the reader will not easily be lured back.”

“Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves, as if they were working on any other project that requires logic: making a shopping list or doing an algebra problem.”

“Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it’s because it is hard.”

Clearing clutter is done in the rewriting of a piece of text.
