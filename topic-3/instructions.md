Welcome, writers! Sharpen your pencils...

Today's tasks:

**Reading assignment**

*On Writing Well* Chapter 2: "Simplicity" and Chapter 3: "Clutter"

**Planning assignment**

Plan your writing portfolio

**Writing assignment**

Write a 1000-word tutorial for a nontechnical reader

Remember to check in with our writing rules document to read about Rule #3 of writing.

## 1. Reading assignment

Read chapters 2 and 3 of *On Writing Well*, which deal with simplicity and clutter. They're short chapters, they won't take long!

We've included summaries of the chapters in the "Files" pane.

As always, read closely and take notes, and watch out for our discussion point on the Slack channel. We want to hear what you think!

## 2. Planning assignment

Return to the prioritised list of types of technical writing you drew up yesterday. Take a look at the first five items on the list. 

During the next few weeks of this programme, we're going to help you produce five writing samples that will form a portfolio for you. The idea is that you will be able to draw on these samples to apply for work or further learning opportunities.

Who knows, maybe you'll have something in the portfolio you'd like to share publicly!

So today you will decide if those five types of technical writing are the ones you'll be trying your hand at. You're welcome to change the list if you want to.

Add your final list to this repl as a new file.

Now you can begin thinking about the content of each of your writing samples.

## 3. Writing assignment

Read [Chapter 3: Hello Little Turtles!](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-3.html) of *Learn Python the Right Way*. This is the chapter the coding track is looking at today.

Write a 1000-word tutorial for a non-technical reader to walk them through creating a short turtle program in Python.

It might be tempting to simply copy and paste the instructions in the book, but remember, your reader won't have the same introduction to Python that the coding track participants have had.

You can design the final program to be as simple or complicated as you like.

Write your tutorial in a new Markdown file in this repl, and submit your assignments by tomorrow morning.

**A note on word count**

In each assignment, we give you an estimated word count to work towards, and it's best to aim to be as close to the word count as you can. However, the word count is just a guide, and there's no need to compromise on your words or sentences to accommodate it.
