## 4. Revising assignment

By now, you should have received feedback on your first writing exercise.

Revisit the piece you wrote on Day 1 and revise it. As you do your revisions, take into account both the feedback you've received from others, and what you've learnt in the course so far.

Jot down any questions that might arise during the process of revising, and any observations you make â€“ whether about your own writing, about the feedback, or about the programme.

You're welcome to keep these notes private, but they might be valuable discussion points for the group Slack, if you're willing to share them there. You're also welcome to tag me, the writing track leader, with any questions you'd like to ask.
