# Chapter 3: Clutter

*“Writing improves in direct ratio to the number of things we can keep out of it that shouldn’t be there.”*

In Chapter 3, Zinsser tells us to "Examine every word you put on paper. You’ll find a surprising number that don’t serve any purpose."

His tips:
* Never use more than one word when one word will do, "use" not "make use of".
* Choose simple words over complex words – more common words with fewer syllables are usually the best words, "use" not "utilise".
* Cut any words that have no function, "in a sense", "sort of", or "tall" in "tall skyscraper".
* Apply the same rigour to paragraphs – take out any sentences that don’t serve a purpose.
