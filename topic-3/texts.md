Day 3 Slack message

It's Day 3 of Ritza's Writing and Coding Course, and here are our writers' tasks for today:

1. Read Chapter 2: "Simplicity" and Chapter 3: "Clutter" of *On Writing Well*.
2. Decide on the five types of technical writing you'll produce samples of over the next few weeks.
3. Write a 1000-word tutorial on writing a basic turtles program in Python for a non-technical reader.

Don't forget to read about Ritza's Rule for Writing #3, and don't be shy to be in touch on Slack if you need any help.

Have fun!
