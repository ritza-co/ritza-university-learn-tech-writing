# Instructions  

The material for this lesson are based on [Chapter 9: Tuples](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-9.html).

For this lesson, you will be required to complete the  exercises below. 

Make sure to write your solutions in the `main.py` file.

1.  We've said nothing in this chapter about whether you can pass tuples as arguments to a function. Construct a small Python example to test whether this is possible, and write up your findings.


2.  Is a pair a generalization of a tuple, or is a tuple a generalization of a pair?


3.  Is a pair a kind of tuple, or is a tuple a kind of pair?
