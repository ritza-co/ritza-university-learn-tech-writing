## Intro 

**Learning Goals:**

1. Students will be able to learn in a no-setup environment so they can focus on code.
2. Students will be able to learn computer science fundamentals.
3. Students will be able to practice by building real-world projects.

**Expected Student Background:** 

This is the best course for beginners to learn Python, not only in the academic context of computer science. As a result, students are not expected to have any prior programming experience.

**Timing:**

This unit is self-paced however, you'll need to dedicate about 15-20 hours/week over the 4-week period.

## Philosophy / Guiding Principles

We believe that by working through this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Python, and gain the confidence and skill to build practical applications.

Part 2 of our Python course is [Code with Replit](https://codewithreplit.com/), a series of Python projects in tutorial form that learners can work through and extend. These tutorials enable learners to see what is possible and gain experience with various libraries.

The combination of these parts: learning the fundamentals and working through the set of tutorials, is the best way to learn Python in 2022.
