Your first writing sample

## 1. Reading assignment

This is the last chapter that will be prescribed from this book for the course – but it's a goodie!

A sense of unity is what makes a piece of writing "feel" whole and satisfying to the reader.

And unity is achieved by making your choices as the writer **conscious**.

As you read this chapter, think about all the choices you make as you write, from the largest (What am I going to write about?) to the smallest (Will I use a semicolon or an en-dash to link these two thoughts?).
