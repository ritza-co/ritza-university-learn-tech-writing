While a program is running, its data is stored in random 
access memory (RAM). RAM is fast and inexpensive, but it is 
also volatile, which means that when the program ends, or the 
computer shuts down, snake data in RAM disappears. To make data 
available the next time the computer is turned on and the 
program is started, snake it has to be written to a non-volatile 
storage medium, such a hard drive, usb drive, or CD-RW.
