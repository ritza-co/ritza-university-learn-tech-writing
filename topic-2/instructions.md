## 1. Reading assignment

Your first task today is to read Chapter 15 "Science & Technology" from [William Zinsser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser)'s book *On Writing Well*.

Since this course is specifically geared towards technical writing, this chapter is a good place for us to begin.

You'll find a PDF version of the chapter in the "Files" pane of this repl, but you'll notice that it can't be viewed in the repl. To download it and view it from your computer, click the three dots that appear when your mouse hovers over the file name and select "Download".

As you're reading the chapter, I encourage you to write down your thoughts about the chapter, anything Zinsser writes that you disagree with, and questions that pop up.

You'll find a summary of the key points of the chapter in the "Files" pane too.

I will post a point from the chapter for discussion to our Slack channel – I hope you'll pitch in with your opinions!

## 2. Practical assignment

Jot down all the types of technical writing you can think of.

Now order the list according to the types of writing you are interested in producing, starting with your highest priority. Leave off any types you're not interested in.

Here are a couple to get you started: end-user documentation, hardware user guides, white papers...

Add your list to this repl as a new Markdown file.

## 3. Writing assignment

Write 500 words on a technical concept of your choice.

If you're stuck for a topic, you'll find some writing prompts in the `prompts.md` file.

Write your assignment in a new file in this repl.

Remember to submit your assignments by tomorrow morning.
