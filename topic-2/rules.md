# Ritza's rules for writing

The rules that are guaranteed to make you a better writer. These rules are not for breaking.

## Rule #1

**Write every day.**

## Rule #2

**Read.**

This is the second rule for a reason: Reading is very nearly as important to developing your writing as writing is.

Read widely, and read critically.

"Read widely" means read fiction and nonfiction, long-form and short-form texts, Buzzfeed and academic papers.

"Read critically" means make a habit of analyzing what you read as you read it: What makes an article, blog post, paper enjoyable to read? What was the writer's purpose in writing the content you're reading? Has the writer presented the content logically? Are there holes in the argument? What is satisfying about this piece of writing? What makes it hard to follow? How does it compare to similar pieces of writing you've read?

When you read critically, you're evaluating the effectiveness of the writing in addition to taking in the information the text contains.

Most importantly, if there is a type of writing that you aim to produce, be sure to read a lot of that type of text. You want to blog? Read a lot of blogs. You want to write creative nonfiction? Technical tutorials? Political think pieces? Then that's what you need to read.

And don't think you only need to read the best examples of any type of writing. Reading trash is a good way to get the hang of how NOT to write!

There are hundreds of reasons writers must read. Here are just a few:
* The more you read, the more the grammar and structure of language will become intuitive.
* There is no better way than reading to improve your vocabulary and your grasp of the nuances of words. This will give your writing precision.
* Read so that you know what's already been said. If you want your writing to contribute something new, you need to know what's already out there.
* Reading contributes to the width and depth of your knowledge: You will know a little bit about a lot of things, and a lot about a select few things. This will be indispensable to making your writing both accessible and valuable.

What are you waiting for? Go read!
