Day 2 Slack message

Happy Day 2, writing track peeps!

Here are your activities for today:
1. Read Chapter 15: "Science & Technology" of *On Writing Well*.
2. Make a list of all the types of technical writing you can think of, then order the list according to the types you'd like to try your hand at. Start with what type of technical writing you're most keen to try, and leave off any you don't want to try at all.
3. Write 500 words on a technical concept.

Don't forget to look at Ritza's rules for writing to find out what Rule #2 is.

I'm here to answer your questions if you have them!
