# Chapter 15: Science & Technology

In Chapter 15 of *On Writing Well*, Zinsser looks at technical writing. Here are some highlights:
* Writing well about technology requires you to work hard to write sentences that form a linear sequence. Zinsser calls this **writing sequentially**.
* Writing about technology must never include fanciful leaps or implied truths – stick to fact and deduction.
* When you write about technology, you can’t assume that your readers know what you assume everybody knows, or that they still remember what was once explained to them.

“Describing how a process works is valuable for two reasons. It forces you to make sure you know how it works. Then it forces you to take the reader through the same sequence of ideas and deductions that made the process clear to you.”

## Zinsser's "upside-down pyramid" model:

* Start with one fact the reader must know before they can learn any more.
* The second sentence broadens what was stated in the first, making the pyramid wider.
* Each subsequent sentence broadens the pyramid further.
* This way, you can gradually move beyond fact into significance.

## Zinsser's tips:

* Help your reader to understand unfamiliar facts by relating them to sights they are familiar with. Reduce the abstract principle to an image they can visualize.
* Always start with too much material, then give your reader just enough.
