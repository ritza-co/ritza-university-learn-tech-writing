# Ritza's rules for writing

Aside from the rules of language, there aren't really any clearly defined rules for writing.

There are writing **skills**, such as grammar, structure, diction, and style. And there are writing **principles**, such as clarity, simplicity, and precision. But try to find a set of **rules** for writing, and you'll get a mix of guidelines and platitudes that mostly refer to writing skills and writing principles, not hard-and-fast rules.

"Rules," people who write about writing love to say, "Are meant to be broken."

At Ritza, we follow a set of rules for writing that govern a writer's approach to their writing, rather than the writing itself. These are rules in the strictest sense: They are meant to be followed closely. And if you do follow our rules, you are guaranteed to become a better writer.

We'll look at them one by one.

## Writing rule #1

**Write every day.**

If you want to improve your writing, this is the most important rule to follow. And there are no shortcuts.

What you write is up to you, but 20-30 minutes of writing is a reasonable target. Some writers swear by writing [morning pages](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/03/morning-pages-change-your-life-oliver-burkeman). Software designer-turned-author Buster Benson digitized and gamified the morning pages to create [750 Words](https://busterbenson.com/750-words/). If you have a big writing goal, or many small ones, setting aside this small chunk of time to focus on writing will help you get there.

Our tip: Be careful not to spend the time you set aside for writing "thinking about writing". During those 20-30 minutes, be sure your pen is moving across the paper or your fingers across the keyboard.

Avoiding writing is something most writers are better skilled at than writing. Developing a habit of writing daily – and making sure you're actually producing words during your writing practice – is your best defense against creeping writing avoidance.

Write every day. Start today.
