# Slack post

Hello to our writing-track participants!

Here’s what you need to do for Day 1:

* Watch the video “The Craft of Writing Effectively”, a lecture delivered by Larry McEnerney, director of the writing program of the University of Chicago - it’s a long one, but it’s worth it!
* Write 500 words on whatever you like. If you’re stuck for what to write about, there are some writing prompts in the Day 1 repl.

I’m here if you have any questions or problems. Have fun!

# Conversation point for Slack

Larry McEnerney is dismissive of using outlines to help you think through a piece of writing. What do you think? Do you or have you used outlines to help you plan a piece of writing?
