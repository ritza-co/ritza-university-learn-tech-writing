# Instructions  

Welcome to our Day 1 repl! 🎉

Here's what you need to do today:

1. Don't forget to join our introductory call at the time you chose. The call isn't mandatory, but it will be a great opportunity to meet the course host and track leads, and get to know your fellow course participants.
2. Watch the video [“The Craft of Writing Effectively”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM), a lecture delivered by Larry McEnerney, director of the writing program of the University of Chicago.
3. Write 500 words on whatever you like. If you're stuck for a topic, or need a little inspiration, there are some writing prompts in a document called `prompts.md` in the "Files" pane. Do your writing exercise in a new file in this repl, and submit the assignment by tomorrow morning.
4. Take a look at "Ritza's writing rules" in the file `rules.md` and get started on Rule #1.
