# Instructions  

Welcome to Day 1! üéâ

Here's what you need to do today:

1. Watch the video [‚ÄúThe Craft of Writing Effectively‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM), a lecture delivered by Larry McEnerney, director of the writing program of the University of Chicago. It's long, but it's worth it. (Protip: Increase the playback speed and clean up your inbox while you're doing it.)
3. Write 500 words on whatever you like. If you're stuck for a topic, or need a little inspiration, there are some writing prompts below. Share your writing for feedback when you're done.
4. Take a look at Ritza's writing rules and get started on Rule #1.
