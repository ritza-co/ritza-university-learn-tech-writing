# Writing prompts

Here are some prompts for todayâ€™s writing exercise:
* Write a reflection about your experience with writing so far, why you want to get better at it, and what you find hard about it (many people find reflection pieces the easiest to write as there are no right or wrong answers, so they are also a good cure for writer's block).
* Write a summary of what you thought were the most interesting parts of the video and why. What did you learn? Remember, right after learning something is often the best time to teach it.
* Write a short tutorial on how to sign up for Replit and create your first repl.
* Read Chapter 1 from [Learn Python the Right Way](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-1.html). Pick a section that you thought was incomplete or could be improved, and write an expansion of it.
* Write a guide / tutorial based on a question from a participant on the coding track.
