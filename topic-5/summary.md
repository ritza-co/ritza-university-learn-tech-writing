# Style

“You have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up.”

* Attempting to “add” style is a mistake if you haven’t first ensured that your writing is serving its purpose.
* “Style is organic to the person doing the writing.” By this, Zinsser means there’s no need to add style to your writing. That will just make it “gaudy” and unnatural.
* “A fundamental rule is: be yourself.”
* To “be yourself” in your writing, you need to *relax* and *be confident*.
* Zinsser acknowledges that it’s hard to relax and be confident, but the remedy he suggests is to begin… and then to edit.
* The best writing to read is warm, as in the opposite of “impersonal”.
* Zinsser recommends using first person: “I” and “me” [Ritza prefers first person plural, “we”, as you can see in our [styleguide](https://styleguide.ritza.co/ritza%27s-writing-rules/Style/#voice-and-tone), because it’s ideal for technical writing such as tutorials].
