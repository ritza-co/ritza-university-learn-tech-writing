# Ritza's rules for writing

The rules that are guaranteed to make you a better writer. These rules are not for breaking.

## Rule #1

**Write every day.**

## Rule #2

**Read.**

## Rule #3

**Know your audience.**

## Rule #4

**Be consistent.**

## Rule #5

**Writing is editing.**

This rule is so important, we've dedicated this entire lesson to it.

Hemingway famously said, "The first draft of anything is shit," and writers repeat this quote like a mantra.

Good writing doesn't emerge from the writer fully formed. Writing is made good by rigorous pruning, jiggling, interrogating, and multiple do-overs.

In other words, to be a good writer, you need to learn how to edit your work, and edit ruthlessly.

I recommend that, for any piece of writing you produce, **no more than 30% of your total writing time should be spent on drafting**. You should aim to **spend 70% of your time focused on refining your text** by rewriting, correcting, reorganising, and polishing.

You'll find our tips for self-editing in the document `editing.md`, which is filled with practical advice for taking your shitty first draft and making it good.
