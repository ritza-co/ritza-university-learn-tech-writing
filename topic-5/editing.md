# Writing is editing

*"The first draft of anything is shit."*

~ Ernest Hemingway

The difference between a mediocre writer and a good writer lies in how they edit their work.

For any piece of writing you produce, you should spend less than a third of the time on drafting it. The rest of your writing time should be spent self-editing so that you turn your shitty first draft into Good Writing.

Here's how you do that.

### 1. Don't edit as you write

Put your head down and write all the way to the end before you begin to self-edit. Pay no attention to poor sentence structure, spelling or grammatical errors, using the wrong word, or any other mistakes you might make during the course of writing your first draft. Some writers go as far as to suggest you don't cross out (or delete, these days). Just write.

### 2. Give it time

This isn't always possible, but you should ideally allow the first draft to "rest" before you return to it. Maybe for as long as it takes for you to have a coffee, maybe for 24 hours, it doesn't matter. Writers of longer-form texts sometimes leave the first draft of a book for months before beginning the self-editing process.

The reason we allow a little time between the first draft and editing is so that you approach the text with fresh eyes and ears. When we move straight into editing from writing the first draft, we are less likely to see what needs to be fixed.

### 3. Find a system that works for you

Experiment to figure out what will work for you in terms of how to approach self-editing.

Here's the three-phase system I use whether I'm editing my own writing or someone else's – feel free to copy and adapt it to suit your needs.

* **Read first.** Read over the whole text; make notes if you like, either in the text or in another document.
* **Phase 1: Do a "global" edit.** In this phase of editing, you're making large, structural changes. This is when you look at:
  * **Logic** – Is the text complete, or are there holes that need to be filled? Does each idea follow on logically from the last, or do you need to move sections around to organise the information better? Have you included anything that detracts from your argument – unnecessary waffle or illogical detours? What can you eliminate?
  * **Conceptual consistency** – Have you been consistent in terms of **concept**? Are there any contradictions? Circular arguments? Ambiguities?
  * **Flow** – Is the pace of the piece consistent? Have you used too many words or too few words for an idea? Have you taken care to set the reader up for each step you take towards the conclusion?
  * **Consistency in tense, voice, tone, and style** – Have you used more than one tense? Does your writing "sound" the same throughout, or does it seem like more than one writer produced it? Have you maintained the same point of view? Does the piece sometimes read like an encyclopedia, and sometimes read like a conversation? Have you been consistently formal, or consistently informal?
* **Phase 2: Do a section-by-section edit.** In this phase, be ruthless about cutting anything that doesn't add value. Are there any repetitions? Can you reduce two long-winded sentences into one concise sentence? Or are there any complicated, winding sentences that could be divided into two (or even three) sentences? Are your paragraph breaks in the correct places? Have you used terms consistently?
* **Phase 3: Do a sentence-by-sentence edit.** Do subject and verb agree (have you used a plural verb for a plural subject)? Are you certain that you understand every word you've used? Have you included any padding phrases or words, like "sort of" or "actually"? Have you used a phrase where one word will do? Are your verbs strong? Have you chosen the simplest, most accurate words for things? Are there any tautologies, like "personal friend"? Are there any of your "writer's tics" that you can delete? Are your sentences well structured? Are there any [dangling participles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_modifier) or [structural ambiguities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity)? What about spelling errors or clumsy punctuation?

### 4. Read aloud

Once you've done your edit, read your writing aloud.

It feels super-strange to do this, but it's the best way for you to identify errors that you will have missed in your self-editing because of your familiarity with the text. Errors that are easy to miss in our own writing are missing words, repeated words, inverted words in common phrases, and easily confused words.

### 5. Use a tool

Sign up for Grammarly – there's no need to install it as an app or add-on, I've found it to be irritating when it makes suggestions as I'm working. But you can copy-paste your text into the online platform, and it often has great suggestions. Just don't assume Grammarly, or any other tool you choose to use, is the final source of truth!
