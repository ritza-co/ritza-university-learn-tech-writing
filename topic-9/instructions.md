_“Within the broad rule of not letting the reader get away, all writers must approach their subject in a manner that most naturally suits what they are writing about and who they are.”_

## 1. Reading assignment

Zinsser considers the lead and the ending in this chapter, giving us a sense of how vital they are to the flow and cohesion of any piece of writing.

This chapter is carefully placed in our course: You'll notice it follows our introduction to the writing process, and it's included in the topic  "structure".

The weight Zinsser gives to the lead and the ending speaks to the importance of the structure of a text. I'm adding some notes about structure to the "Files" pane.

But the relevance of the lead and the ending to your writing process is this piece of advice I'm going to offer you (you'll thank me later, I promise): Write your introduction last.

Feel free to jot down some notes about how you'd like to introduce your subject before you launch into putting the bulk of your words down, but save writing the introduction for the end.

Give it a try, and please let me know how it works for you!

## 2. Planning assignment

You may know of [Divio](https://www.divio.com), the cloud management platform.

Divio developed an excellent guide to developing technical documentation.

Take a look at the page ["About the structure"](https://documentation.divio.com/structure/) from the guide, especially the graphic that divides technical documentation into types.

If your interest is piqued and you'd like to read more, feel free to explore the rest of Divio's guide. But remember that, as valuable as this resource is, don't assume Divio is the final word of truth in these matters.

Hopefully you'll be inspired to tackle your first writing sample now!

Sketch out a roadmap for your first writing sample. You might find it helpful to do this by hand. You don't need to share it.

Consider:
* Who is your reader?
* How broad or narrow will your subject be?
* What context is important to include?
* How will you organise the information?
* How many sections will you need to divide the text into?
* What will each section cover?
* Do you need subheadings? What will they be?

For the purposes of planning, remember that a writing sample should probably not be shorter than about 250 words, but shouldn't exceed about 2000 words.

# 3. Writing assignment

Write 750 words of your first writing sample.

This is a first draft (they're shitty, remember?), so don't spend too much time on it. Don't worry about an introduction or conclusion, just go for getting the most important bits of the content down.

If your knowledge is incomplete, don't do any research now. You can make "notes to self" in the text, which you can use at a later stage to guide your further investigations.
