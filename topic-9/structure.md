# Structure

You've probably heard the phrase "form follows function."

It's a design principle coined by the architect [Louis Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan), who's known as the "father of the skyscraper."

What "form follows function" means for your writing is that the structure of a text depends on its **purpose**.

The purpose of technical writing is to inform.

Informative writing must be:
* Clear
* Organised
* Accurate

How you structure your technical writing will contribute to the clarity and organisation of the text, but here's the good news: There's really only one structure that works for technical writing, and that is a **sequential structure**.

I'm hoping that this rings a bell for you.

On Day 2, Zinsser told us that writing about technology requires us to **write sequentially**. Our sentences should follow a linear sequence.

And that's about the sum of it.

Giving your writing a sequential structure is taking one step at a time.
