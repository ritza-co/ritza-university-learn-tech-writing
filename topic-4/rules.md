# Ritza's rules for writing

The rules that are guaranteed to make you a better writer. These rules are not for breaking.

## Rule #1

**Write every day.**

## Rule #2

**Read.**

## Rule #3

**Know your audience.**

## Rule #4

**Be consistent.**

This rule applies to the minutiae of writing, like punctuation and capitalisation, as much as the overall practice of writing, and everything between the two extremes.

Being consistent begins with your writing practice (Remember Rule #1?). Being consistent means being thorough in your research, and diligent about accuracy. Being consistent means ensuring there are no holes in what you write, no missing steps from this thought to the next that cause your reader to stumble.

But where consistency is most obvious (or obviously lacking, as the case may be) is in the presentation of your writing: In the paragraphs and the sentences, in how you punctuate and capitalise, in your spelling, in the tense you write in, in your voice. Even in your style.

When your writing is inconsistent, it becomes unclear, and the purpose of the writing – the purpose of writing is always, always, at its core, communication – is not achieved. The reader misunderstands what they read, or gets bored and stops reading, or doubts your authority in the subject matter.

The good news is that consistency, like all the disciplines of writing, becomes habit with practise.

So how do you ensure that you are being consistent?
* Rewrite, revise, self-edit. Become alert to all the details of your writing.
* Question every choice you make in your writing. Is that the correct place to begin a new paragraph? Should this sentence be divided into two? Have I leapt too quickly between ideas and caused confusion? Did I previously use single or double quote marks?
* Make sure you know the meaning of the words you use.
* Nurture a deep respect for punctuation. Novice writers treat punctuation like a troublesome convention they must accommodate. The skilled writer knows that punctuation enhances meaning, gives it light and shade. A misplaced comma to the trained writer's eye is like a bum note in a symphony.
* Learn when to use "that" and when to use "which".
