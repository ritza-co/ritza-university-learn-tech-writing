By now you should have received feedback on the explainer piece you wrote on Day 2.

Write three different versions of the same piece:
1. A high-level version for a peer with equal technical knowledge. The challenge in this one is, how will you bring something new to the subject?
2. A version for a non-technical reader. This is likely to be a revised version of Day 2's writing exercise.
3. A version for a teen who's learning about it at school. Let's be more specific and say your reader is 13-14 years old, about 9th grade.
