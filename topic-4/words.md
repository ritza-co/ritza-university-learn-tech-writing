# Words  

In his chapter about words, Zinsser says, "Remember that words are the only tools you’ve got. Learn to use them with originality and care. And also remember: somebody out there is listening."

Using the wrong word weakens your writing by making it unclear, ambiguous, incorrect, and confusing. It makes you sound hesitant or bombastic, and undermines your credibility.

Good writing is strong and precise. You achieve strength and precision by selecting the perfect word. To know what the perfect word is, you need to have a wide vocabulary, and thorough knowledge of the words in your vocabulary and their shades of meaning and connotation.

Be curious about words: Where does a word come from? Does it have multiple meanings? How is it different from its synonyms? What connotations does it carry?

Here are our top tips for words.

* **Be sure you know the meaning of the word you're using.** Be cautious using unfamiliar words. If you have any doubts, look it up!
* **Choose short words over long words.** If you're interested in etymology, the history of Germanic and Latinate words is fascinating. As a general rule, the shorter, more common words are most likely of Germanic origin, and therefore belong to the core of the English language. They're stronger, clearer. Latinate words are words that became part of the English language later, borrowed either from Latin or French, and they're often longer and prettier-sounding, but their meaning can be less straightforward. Think "give up" versus "relinquish", "ask" versus "inquire". Don't follow this advice too rigidly, though. Sometimes the Latinate word is the perfect choice!
* **Use common words.** Common words make your writing easier to understand. Sometimes, you might purposefully use a less common word (like when I chose "bombastic" above), but then you must be certain of your reasons for the choice.
* **Don't be wordy.** Wordiness is when you use more words than are necessary. Be careful of phrases like "make use of", "due to the fact that", and "in order to".
* **Use strong verbs.** Strong verbs are specific and can do all the heavy-lifting of your writing so that you don't need to use modifiers (like adjectives and adverbs) or qualifiers (like "very" or "really"). Weak verbs are most commonly forms of "to be" and "to have", and tend to dilute your writing. To check your verbs are strong, follow these guidelines:
  * Instead of "says" or "tells", consider "explains", "suggests", "describes".
  * The word "gets" is a flag: can you be more specific? "Achieves", "retrieves", "accomplishes", or "becomes" are all possible alternatives.
  * "Do" or "does" are words that often appear with another verb and can probably be simplified: Not "we do need to..." but "we need to..."
  * "Has" or "have" are versatile verbs that can mean dozens of things. Try replace them with more specific verbs, like "includes", "involves", "owns". Especially in technical writing, chances are we never "have to" do anything. We "need to" or "must".
  * Always interrogate your use of "make". If "make" appears in this kind of construction: "make a plan" or "make use of", you can most likely lose it: just "plan" or "use" will do.
  * A verb with the gerund ("-ing") can usually be replaced by the original form: "It is taking" can be "It takes".
* **Don't use empty adjectives.** Empty adjectives have little specific meaning, like "very", "really", "extremely". Many marketing terms are also empty adjectives, like "unique", "simple", "best".
* **Don't use padding words or phrases.** Padding words and phrases do no work in your sentences. Remove any useless qualifiers, like "some" or "very", and intesifiers, like "a bit" or "a lot". "Actually" can be deleted from your sentences 99 percent of the time.
* **Look out for your writer's tics.** All writers have tics – words or phrases a writer falls back on frequently. What are yours?
