## 1. Reading assignment

Read Zinsser's chapters on "Words" and "Usage" (they're in the "Files" pane as usual).

Instead of summaries of these chapters, we've included some additional notes on words here. Hope you find them useful!

As always, the Slack channel is ready and waiting to hear from you. Bring your questions, observations, controversial opinions!

## 2. Planning assignment

Today you will decide: Which writing sample will you begin with? What will it cover? What will your approach be?

If you feel inspired to, begin your research for this exercise now.

## 3. Writing assignment

Think back to a technical project you've been involved in recently â€“ software, game, platform, app.

I'm a journalist with no experience covering tech, and I'm writing about your product for a general interest publication with a large, diverse readership. Your next VC could very well be a member of the publication's audience.

Write 500-1000 words for me describing what your product does, why it's unique, and how it works.
