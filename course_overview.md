# Tips for peer-to-peer feedback

Good feedback is like rocket fuel for fast-tracking learning, but bad feedback can paralyse the person whose work is being critiqued.

Here are our tips for giving great feedback:
1. **Focus on the coding or writing** (not the coder or writer). Don’t say, “You’re rambling too much here.” Say instead, “This sentence doesn’t contribute to my understanding of your topic.”
2. When assessing someone’s work for feedback, **begin by assessing overall effectiveness**, rather than focussing too much on the smaller details. Structure, logic, cohesion, and clarity are the points to consider first. Syntax, grammar, spelling, and punctuation only need feedback if the higher-order elements are in place.
3. **Be selective.** It’s not necessary to point out every problem with a peer’s work. Choose the top three issues and focus on those.
4. **Be specific.** If your feedback is that the work doesn’t have a logical flow, be sure to indicate the specific places that flow needs to be addressed.
5. It can be helpful to **include positive feedback**, so do try to point out parts of a work that you liked. But never include positive feedback if it isn’t honest or if it’s contrived.
