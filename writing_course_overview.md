## Course content

The content of Ritza's Writing for Coders Course is partly based on the book [*On Writing Well* by William Zinsser](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060006641?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tpbk_1&storeType=ebooks).

We highly recommend the book to any nonfiction writer (or any writer!) who would like to improve their craft. However, you are not required to source the book in order to complete this course. We will provide you with limited extracts of the book to meet the needs of your assignments.

We discourage the sharing of any material we provide for the course with others, as this may contravene copyright laws.
