# Instructions  

The material for this lesson is based on [Chapter 13: Files](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-13.html).
For this lesson, you will be required to complete the  exercises below. 

Make sure to write your solutions in the `main.py` file.

1.  Write a program that reads a file and writes out a new file with the lines in reversed order (i.e. the first line in the old file becomes the last one in the new file.)


2.  Write a program that reads a file and prints only those lines that contain the substring `snake`.


3.  Write a program that reads a text file and produces an output file which is a copy of the file, except the first five columns of each line, which contains a four-digit line number, followed by a space. Start numbering the first line in the output file at 1. Ensure that every line number is formatted to the same width in the output file. Use one of your Python programs as test data for this exercise: your output should be a printed and numbered listing of the Python program.


4.  Write a program that undoes the numbering of the previous exercise: it should read a file with numbered lines and produce another file without line numbers.
