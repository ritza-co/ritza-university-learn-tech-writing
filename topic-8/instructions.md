Write 500 words on your writing process

## 1. Reading assignment

Zinsser's "Bits & Pieces" is full of excellent, practical writing advice that you can put into practice immediately. It's one of the longer chapters, but I encourage you to read it closely, and make notes.

## 2. Planning assignment

Have you decided on which piece of writing for your portfolio you'll be starting with?

Head over to our Slack channel and tell me there:
* What type of technical writing you'll be tackling first.
* What the topic is (try not to be too broad or too vague).

## 3. Writing assignment

Take a look at the notes on the writing process in the `process.md` document.

Write 500 words about your writing process. Include:
* What activities are involved, and how much time each takes.
* Which parts of the process are more enjoyable to you and why.
* Which parts of the process you struggle with and why.
* What you'd like to work on improving.
* Any other observations you may have. These might include whether or not you experience doubt or anxiety during the process, what your internal dialogue is and whether it changes at different stages, or why you work the way you do.
