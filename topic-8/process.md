# The writing process

You may think that learning how to write well involves brushing up on your grammar and memorising which sentence structure to use where, and you wouldn't be wrong.

But learning how to write well is also about getting right a bunch of stuff that happens alongside the act of putting words to paper (or monitor, of course).

Writing well involves these critical skills, too:
* **Discipline**, which includes
  * **Committing to writing:** Put your bum in the chair and write.
  * **Quieting the editor:** There are two parts to writing. They shouldn't be done at once.
  * **Rewriting:** Sharing your first draft as if it's your last is like wearing just your jocks to a wedding.
  * **Delivering:** What you write will never be done. There comes a time when you have to let go.
  * **Practice:** Writing is a marathon. You need to stay in shape.
* **Courage**, which means
  * **Overcoming fear:** The blank page is terrifying. You need the courage to face your fear.
  * **Being vulnerable:** Writing is an act of vulnerability. You need to be prepared to be wrong.
  * **Being yourself:** This is surprisingly hard to achieve â€“ it's tempting to pretend, but your readers will see through it.
  * **Anticipating rejection:** Your writing won't always hit the mark. That's OK.
  * **Accepting criticism:** Whether it's an editor helping you improve your work, or a dissatisfied client, or a reader who doesn't like what you've written, a writer will be subject to criticism. Likely a lot of criticism.
* **Cognitive flexibility**, particularly
  * **Intentional imagination:** Writers need to be imaginative, but not only in the sense of creating imaginary worlds, characters, or stories. You need to stimulate your imagination to approach subjects from a new angle, to solve problems, to make unusual connections, and to answer questions that haven't been
asked. Imagination is key to theory of mind, which informs our view of the reader we write for.
  * **Self awareness:** Writers need to be able to observe their thoughts, identify their strengths and weaknesses, question their beliefs and assumptions, and learn to distinguish between the subjective and objective.

Being conscious of how these competencies influence writing and working actively to improve them is a powerful way to 10x your work.

Your **writing process** is both an instrument to assess how you're faring with these less-obvious skills, and a means to overcome any challenges you may have and leverage your strengths.

## Picturing the writing process

Your writing process is unique to you, and there's no prescription for the process that will magically transform your output or confidence.

Here are some general observations about the writing process that you might find helpful:

* The writing process often begins long before you sit down to write.
* Many writers find they have to work hard to overcome avoidance. Avoidance can include such behaviours as getting caught up in more research than is necessary, or developing an overly complex mental plan of what you're about to write.
* Deadlines are a useful tool for combatting avoidance. If a deadline isn't imposed on you from outside, consider giving yourself a deadline (although this might not be helpful if there's no consequence for missing a deadline).
* Some writers swear by outlines, others dismiss them as useless.
* Once you've begun stringing sentences together, you may encounter a number of different hurdles at various stages. These can include self-doubt or the feeling that you can't get a grasp on your thoughts.
* The urge to edit as you write is common, and you should do your best not to do it. Don't edit as you write because it may be a symptom of avoidance, but also because the analytic nature of editing is contrary to the creative flow that is necessary for the production of words in the first phase of writing, and may even inhibit it. This is what is meant by "quieting the editor".
* It can be helpful to allow your writing to "rest" before you begin the process of self-editing.
* As you begin self-editing, you may experience the urge to toss your entire text and start again from scratch. Sometimes this is a good idea. Most times, probably not.
* Once you get the hang of self-editing, you might find it becomes one of the most enjoyable stages of writing. However, you may be overdoing the self-editing stage as another means to avoid completing or sharing your writing, or out of a sense of inadequacy.
* Some writers like to have a range of writing projects at various stages going at the same time. When you encounter a particularly thorny issue or feel "blocked", it can be helpful to refocus for a while.

## Mastering the writing process

Being conscious of your writing process is the first step towards mastering it.

Once you have a good picture of *how* you write, start thinking about *why* you write the way you do.

Do you skimp on self-editing because reading what you've written is a bit like hearing your own voice on a recording? Or do you have a multitude of unfinished writing projects because you lose motivation once the thrill of starting has worn off?

Next, start thinking about how you can manipulate your writing process to get better results. Start with the end in mind: How would you like to improve? You might want to increase your output, or you might want to write faster, or you might just want to develop a process that makes writing as painless as possible.

Think about:
* Which parts of the writing process do you feel most competent in?
* Which parts of the writing process take up more time?
* Are there parts of writing that are better at different times of the day? For example, you might find the first phase of writing better in the evenings when there's less time pressure on you, or the self-editing phase is better early in the morning when you're mentally fresh.
* Can you do any parts of your writing while you're busy with other things? The earliest stages of planning, for example, can be done while you're showering or cooking dinner. Self-editing can be done in short bursts between phone calls.
* What activity should take up the bulk of your focused writing time?

Then, experiment.

Be intentional and methodical about experimenting with your writing process. Be conscious as you try out different ways of working. Document the results. Change up anything that doesn't work. When you find something that increases your productivity or the quality of what you write, maximise it.
