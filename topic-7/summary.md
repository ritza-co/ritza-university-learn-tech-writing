# Chapter 16: Business Writing

*“Countless careers rise or fall on the ability or the inability of employees to state a set of facts, summarize a meeting or present an idea coherently.”*

William Zinsser, *On Writing Well*

Here's what Zinsser says about business writing:

* The principles of writing well apply to all types of business writing as much as any other kind of writing.
* Business writing includes memos, reports, analyses, and even Post-Its.
* [Our addition: Today, most of our business writing involves email.]
* Fear of writing strips business communication of humanity.
* In business writing, people tend to use abstractions like "profitibility", and Latinate terms like "utilization".
* This type of writing does not invite you to read it. Zinsser calls it "suffocating".
* He says, pompous business writing makes it hard for us to imagine the people involved in the business.
* We connect with people, and our business writing should encourage connection.
* "How we write and how we talk," Zinsser says, "is how we define ourselves."
* Zinsser gives us four principles for how to write effectively for business: "clarity, simplicity, brevity and humanity."
* Use active verbs.
* Avoid "concept nouns".
* Any subject can be made accessible in good English.
* We want **plain talk** and **human contact** in our communications.
