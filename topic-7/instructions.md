Practising self-editing

## 1. Reading assignment

Given the volume of email communication we all navigate daily, I think Chapter 16 "Business writing" will resonate with you.

We've provided a summary here, too.

## 2. Writing assignment

Select one of your previous writing exercises and do a thorough self-edit on it using the tips and tricks you've learnt in the course so far.

If you'd like to write a little bit about how it was for you, whether you had any "Aha!" moments, or any other observations you have about the exercise, I'd love to see it!
